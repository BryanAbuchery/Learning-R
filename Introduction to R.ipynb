In general, even if it's allowed, it's best to not use other function names (e.g., c, T, mean, data, df, weights). If in doubt, check the help to see if the name is already in use.\n",

In R, three popular style guides come from [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html), [Jean Fan](https://jef.works/R-style-guide/) and the [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/). The tidyverse style is very comprehensive and may seem overwhelming at first.
